# Stickhop Source Code
Since I'm starting from scratch for about the 4th time, I thought I'd share the source code to one of my favorite projects to work on.
## Description
Stickhop is **going to be** a small wave shooter simulator with a physics-based player controller and characters, and multiple maps.  
It is still very much unfinished and has been rewritten several times in private. The private, early builds are available in the Github Releases section, however they are EXTREMELY janky and I doubt they are even playable. 
This is mostly a test project to learn Unity, so don't take it too seriously...
